# Retirement Portfolio Analysis, Risk and Return Metrics

This Jupyter notebook uses various risk and return metrics to analyze the performance of various funds compared to the S&P 500. 

This is a challenge assignment from Rice's FinTech Bootcamp program due on July 7, 2022. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate our knowledge using risk and return metrics, applying them to a real world scenario. 

## Technologies

This program is written in Python (3.7.13) and developed using JupyterLabs notebooks using Windows. Libraries incorporated are matplotlib (3.1.1), pathlib, numpy (1.21.6) and pandas (1.1.5) (see parenthesis for versions used in program development).

## Installation Guide

Downloading the code & associated files using `git clone` from the repository is sufficient to download the program, ensure that the associated libaries (see Technologies section) are installed on your machine as well. If there are any issues with the library functions please refer to the versions used for app development (see Technnologies section for this information as well).  Please note that this is a Jupyter notebook. 

## Usage

This notebook specifically compares risk and return metrics of 4 fund portfolios (Berkshire Hathaway, Soros Fund Management LLC, Paulson & Co Inc, Tiger Global Management LLC) to the S&P 500 within the period from October 1, 2014 to September 11, 2020. The code can easily be adapted to compare other funds or securities to a benchmark over a miscellaneous timeframe to analyze risk and return. 

## Risk and return metrics

Some of the metrics that are being used to analyze the data in this notebook are standard deviation `std()`, variance `var()`, covariance `cov()`, Sharpe Ratio, and beta.  

## Contributors

Project contributors are the Rice FinTech bootcamp program team (instructor Eric Cadena) who developed the tasks for this project along with myself (Paula K) who's written the code to explore the data.
